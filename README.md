**What is GPT-3?**

GPT-3, or the third generation Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a neural network machine learning model trained using internet data to generate any type of text. Developed by OpenAI, it requires a small amount of input text to generate large volumes of relevant and sophisticated machine-generated text.

GPT-3's deep learning neural network is a model with over **175 billion** machine learning parameters. To put things into scale, the largest trained language model before GPT-3 was Microsoft's Turing NLG model, which had 10 billion parameters.

Learn more about GPT-3 in [this great article](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/GPT-3) and of course on [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/)

**üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Configuration**

* Configure the backstory of your chatbot by editing the `backstory` property in the `chatData.json` file in the root directory of the project.

    ```
    {
        "backstory": "The following is a conversation with a chat AI created for Discord. The chat AI is helpful, creative, clever and very friendly."
    }
    ```

* Configure some predefined conversations to further specify the properties of the chatbot's responses. To do this, you need to edit the `predefinedConversations` property in the `chatData.json` file at the root of the project.

    ```
    {
        "predefinedConversations":[
            {
                "human":"Hello, who are you?",
                "ai":"I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?"
            },
            {
                "human":"How are you today?",
                "ai":"I'm feeling great today. Thanks for speaking with me."
            },
            {
                "human":"What is your favorite thing to do?",
                "ai":"I love to chat with people like you!"
            }
    }
    ```

* Configure the maximum number of saved conversations by editing the `MAX_CHAT_HISTORY` property in the `.env` file in the project root directory.
 
    The default value is 100.

    ```
    MAX_CHAT_HISTORY = 69
    ```
